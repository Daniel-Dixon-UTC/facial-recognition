GCSE Computer Science: Summer Project  
Difficulty: Titan  
Deadline: 7th September 2018 

 

Your challenge is to research, prototype, test and build a program that has the ability to recognise a person’s face from a photograph: 

  -  The user should be able to input a photograph and the program returns the name of the person within that photograph  

  -  The user should be able to input a batch of photographs and the program returns the name(s) of the person(s) within the batch of photographs 

 	 -  Example output: “In photograph 1 there was ‘Mr Smith, Mr Jones, and Mrs Jones”,  

  -  The user should be able to input a name, ie. Mrs Jones, and it returns every photograph that person appears in 

  -  Mr W should be able to give the program 10 photographs of 3 different people (30 photographs in total) and the program should be able to name each of the 3 people.  

  	-  This is Facebook/Google-level of complexity. Not for the faint hearted.
